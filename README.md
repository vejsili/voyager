# Aircraft simulator - 6 DoF

A 6-DoF aircraft is simulated with MATLAB Simulink. The project is built from scratch. 

Aerodynamic and propulsive forces had been taken into account, as required by flight dynamics equations. WGS84 model is used for the atmosphere.

Here, the simulated range is shown for the aircraft on a glide, from altitude of 1000 m :
