# Aircraft simulator - 6 DoF

<<<<<<< HEAD
A 6-DoF aircraft is simulated with MATLAB Simulink. The project is built from scratch. 

A model of aerodynamic and propulsive forces had been taken into account, as required by flight dynamics equations. The simulator uses WGS84 to model the atmosphere.
Here, some results are shown for the aircraft on a glide.
