# Design of Variable Area Nozzle for UHBPR Turbofan Engine
41st International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Triennal Assembly set the long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (Montr√©al, 7/10/2022).

Therefore, the new generation of aircraft is expected to reduce noise, NOx emissions, and fuel burn, above all, relative to the Boeing 737-800 equipped with the CFM56-7B engine. To accomplish such a challenge, different strategies are studied and applied, such as the Variable Area Nozzle concept, which will benefit engine performance at low Mach numbers, especially during Take-Off (TOF).

# [Aerodynamic Multi-Objective Optimization of a NACA 64(12)-10 Stator Cascade in an Axial Compressor](https://github.com/vejsili/voyager/blob/main/docs/Vejsili_Mirsad_Project_MAOM_rev4_Open.pdf)
The study of turbomachinery is an enchanting discipline, chatacterized by the captivating physics governing the operation of these machines.
Another crucial aspect lies in their application: each machine is meticulously designed for a specific purpose, tailored to meet precise requirements.
For instance, imagine to compare an aircraft engine and a naval thruster: while both serve the function of propulsion, their designs inherently differ.
Also, examining specific examples such as the P&W PT6 on the P.180 and the RR Viper on MB-339 highlights the variations in architectures and performance even within the realm of aircraft engines.
It is for this reason that optimization techniques play a vital role in the compelling process of turbomachinery design, which begins with 2D analysis.

This project, in particular, aims to enhance the performance of a 2D stator cascade within a known axial compressor through geometric optimization.
It is crucial to emphasize that the outcomes of the 2D analysis significantly impact the performance of the entire aircraft engine, underscoring its fundamental importance.

# Aircraft simulator - 6 DoF

A 6-DoF aircraft is simulated with MATLAB Simulink from scratch. 

Aerodynamic and propulsive forces had been taken into account. WGS84 atmosphere model was chosen.
