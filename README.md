# Aircraft simulator - 6 DoF

I worked on a simulator of 6-DoF aircraft with MATLAB Simulink. To model the aircraft, aerodynamic and propulsive forces had been taken into account, as required by flight dynamics equations. WGS84 model is used for the atmosphere.
Here, some results are shown. The aircraft is clearly on a glide.
