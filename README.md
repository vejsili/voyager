# Aerodynamic multi-objective optimization of a NACA 64(12)-10 in statoric cascade of axial compressor
At the very foundation of turbomachinery design there is 2D cascade analysis. The project aimed to improve performance for a 2D statoric cascade of an axial compressor by implementing a geometric optimization. The performance of compressor are pivotal for the overall behaviour of gas turbine engine.

The image above shows IGV and statoric cascades of a turbojet axial compressor.

# Aircraft simulator - 6 DoF

A 6-DoF aircraft is simulated with MATLAB Simulink. The project is built from scratch. 

Aerodynamic and propulsive forces had been taken into account, as required by flight dynamics equations. WGS84 model is used for the atmosphere.

Here, simulated endurance and range are shown for the aircraft on a glide, starting from an altitude point of 1000 m :
