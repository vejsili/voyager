# Aircraft simulator - 6 DoF

A 6-DoF aircraft is simulated with MATLAB Simulink. The project is built from scratch. 

Aerodynamic and propulsive forces had been taken into account, as required by flight dynamics equations. WGS84 model is used for the atmosphere.

Here, simulated endurance and range are shown for the aircraft on a glide, starting from an altitude point of 1000 m :
